# Monophonic-Synthesizer-Assembly-AVR-ATMega-328PB
Monophonic variable-frequency synthesizer with different waveforms. 

When attached to an AVR ATMega-328PB built with the hardware schematic provided, this code creates
a variable-frequency synthesizer with a choice of 3 shapes of waveform. To choose between sawtooth,
sine, and triangle wavelengths, simply uncomment the corresponding loop jumps and ADC choice (explained
in code comments).
